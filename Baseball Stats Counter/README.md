## Description:

In this assignment, I wrote Python script that reads box scores from a file and computes the Cardinals' players' batting averages in a particular season. I used regular expression to parse players' names, at-bats, hits, and runs from the input file, and ran the script from the command line. The output is then printed to the console.
