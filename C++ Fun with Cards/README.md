# Intro  
  I developed this project over the course of one semester for CSE332 Object Oriented Software Development Laboratory. The code tracks my progress as I learned C++ and its various charms. The code ultimately culminates in Lab 3, where I and a teammate collaborated to implement a playable card game built entirely from the foundations of the previous labs. 
  
# Lab 0 Objectives: Basic program structure, data movement and execution control concepts
  * C++ header files and C++ source files,
  * C++ STL input and output streams,
  * C++ functions,
  * C++ precompiler directives,
  * basic C++ data types (including enumerations and C style and C++ style strings), and
  * basic uses of structs
  * [Lab 0 Instructions](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse332/lab0/)
  
# Lab 1 Objectives: Extend C++ language features by using more advanced techniques
  * use of member operators and algorithms from the C++ STL
  * adding a less-than comparison operator (operator<) to a struct
  * using the STL sort algorithm to order objects
  * [Lab 1 Instructions](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse332/lab1/index.html)
  
# Lab 2 Objectives: Further develop use of C++ language features by making more extensive use of C++ classes and structs
  * use STL shuffle algorithm to "shuffle" a deck of card objects
  * declaring and defining C++ classes, and implementing functions like shuffle, load, and deal for Deck class objects
  * define operators for the sort algorithm (when ranking card hands)
  * [Lab 2 Instructions](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse332/lab2/index.html)
  
# Lab 3 Objectives: Final project, implement a game that will
  * maintain and display the status of a multi-player game of 5 card draw poker 
  * parse command-line arguments to identify the initial players in the game
  * within each round of play allow players to discard cards from and add cards to their hands, and print out a ranking of the resulting hands
  * between rounds allow current players to leave the game and new players to enter the game, saving information for players who leave in files so that if they re-join the game later the files can be used to restore their statistics from previous rounds of play.
