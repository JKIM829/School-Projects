### Notes about scripts in calendar ###
* The calendar itself is built solely from code found in the javascript files in this repository and the calendar API on the course website. It has no dependencies on the bootstrap external library.
* I used bootstrap plugins and ui to create the dialog boxes that show event information in a calendar. The events are shown with the tools in these libraries, but the code for retrieving/creating/deleting/editing the events are found in javascript files in repository.
* I used scripts from http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-dropdown/#2 to makes the dropdown boxes used when someone tries to edit an event. Those scripts are in my repository, and I noted that in the comments of my main calendar html file.


### Creative Portion ###

* Events have colors and tags (both tags and colors can be edited)
* Use of dialog boxes and dropdown forms to edit and delete events. Also includes a confirmation check for deleting events
